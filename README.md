# rules.ashton.json
Simple ruleset for TF2 Bot Detector that detects bots via links and other junk that is spammed in the chat.

To use, place rules.ashton.json in TF2 Bot Detector's cfg folder.

I will update this as soon as I am aware of any new bots. If you know of a bot that doesn't get picked up, leave an issue and I will get on it.
